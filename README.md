<a name="objective">## 🎯 Objective

### Course Objectives

Boston Route Radar is a full-stack web application built for CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern University. The project demonstrates:

- Building and consuming a Restful APIs with Node.js and Express
- Integrating a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for persistent storage
- Applying modern UI frameworks (Bootstrap) for aesthetically pleasing and responsive design
- Implementing full CRUD operations across multiple data collections
- Deploying the application and database

### Broader Objectives

Create a practical civic tool that:

- Empowers residents to report and track local infrastructure issues
- Gives city officials visibility into active, backlog, and resolved problems
- Surfaces city-led projects so the public can stay informed
- Bridges the gap between government and the communities they serve

---

## ✨ Features

### Issues Tracker

Residents can submit infrastructure issues (e.g. potholes, broken signals, downed signage) and view all active reports submitted by the community. Each issue card displays a photo, description, location, status, and a button to edit the information or delete the issue.

### City Projects Tracker

A page that will surface official city projects — infrastructure initiatives, road resurfacing plans, transit improvements, and more.

This feature brings transparency to city government by connecting residents with the work being done on their behalf.

### Filtering & Status Views

Issues can be browsed with filters to show all community issues or just your own submissions. Status indicators help distinguish between active, in-progress, and resolved reports.

## 🤖 AI Assistance

### How AI Was Used

**Issues Usage** - A combination of Claude and Gemini were utilized in learning more about how NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express all work together. For more specific technical challenges, AI was used in some of the following examples:

- Assistance with 'injecting' the cards correctly into the issues div element and preserve the correct dimension, rows, columns, etc...
- Creating and utilizing the update modal
- Understanding how and where to place event listeners on the buttons controlling update and delete. Should they get placed one time? During the creation of each card? etc...

**README Documentation** — Claude AI was used to help structure and format this README based on project details and a preferred style from a prior project. The repository owners then made adjustments and modifications as necessary.

**Debugging & Troubleshooting** — AI assisted with diagnosing Express routing issues, MongoDB query patterns, and Bootstrap layout behavior.

**Deployment** - AI was used to assist in the deployment process as this is one of the contributors first deploying with Render.

### AI Usage Philosophy

AI was used as a **development accelerator**, not a shortcut. All generated code was reviewed, understood, and integrated intentionally. The goal was to spend less time on boilerplate and more time building features that matter.
